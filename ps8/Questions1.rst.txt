=============

Norm
----

* What changes did you make for mpi_norm? Copy and paste relevant code           lines that contain your edits to your report. Provide comments in the code near your edits to explain your approach.



Below MPI::Scatter is used to split the global vector x to local vectors stored in ranks. The address of x and local_x is given by location of the first element of corresponding vector. That address is passed as input to scatter.









* Per our discussions in lectures past about weak vs strong scaling, do
  the plots look like what you would expect? Describe any (significant)
  differences (if any).





* For strong scaling, at what problem size (and what number of nodes) does parallelization stop being useful?  Explain.









Solving Laplace’s Equation
--------------------------

* What changes did you make for halo exchange in jacobi? Copy and paste relevant code lines that contain your edits to your report. Provide comments in the code near your edits to explain your approach.
If you used a different scheme for extra credit in mult, show that as well.

* What changes did you make for mpi_dot? Copy and paste relevant code lines that contain your edits to your report. Provide comments in the code near your edits to explain your approach.


* What changes did you make for ir in mpiMath.hpp? Copy and paste relevant code lines that contain your edits to your report. Provide comments in the code near your edits to explain your approach.

* (583 only) What changes did you make for cg in mpiMath.hpp? Copy and paste relevant code lines that contain your edits to your report. Provide comments in the code near your edits to explain your approach.


Scaling
-------


* Per our discussions in lectures past about weak vs strong scaling, do the plots look like what you would expect? Describe any (significant) differences (if any).

* For strong scaling, at what problem size (and what number of nodes) does parallelization stop being useful? Explain.
